# Xplore

Hi! I'm Cedar and I would love to appreciate you for checking out Xplore, it's a great pleasure. We are really looking forward to having you as a contributor to a great community that is building a great product.

## What is Xplore?

Xplore is a community-driven open-source platform for passionate writers and voracious readers to share and discover beautiful works while actively involved in a community of like-minded individuals. Simply put, Xplore is a community-driven open-source alternative to Wattpad.

### Why Xplore?

As a writer myself who have tried so many platforms for budding writers and readers, one thing I have so craved and continuously found missing is a community. A place for continuous interaction that makes it easier for an author to reach his/her readers and vice-versa.

This is what Xplore is here to solve; with Xplore, the aim is to bridge the gap between authors/writers and readers, so that readers can easily interact with the authors and share what they love about their books.

It is also a community where writers can reach out to fellow writers and get access to a variety of helpful information. They can continuously find out what books to read and join book clubs of their liking to keep things interesting and fun always.

## Technology

- Figma for design
- Asp.net for backend development
- React for frontend development
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Community

We believe that it takes a community to make a difference so we would love to invite you to join our community of developers as we build on this idea and strive to make a difference for the next generation of authors and readers.
