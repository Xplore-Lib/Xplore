## What is Xplore?

Xplore is a community driven open source platform to passonate writers and voracious readers to share and discover beautiful works while being actively involed in a community of like minded individuals. Simply put, Xplore is an community driven open source alternative to Wattpad.

### Why Xplore
As a writer myself who have tried so many platforms for budding writers and readers, one thing I have so creaved and continously found missing is a community. A place for continous interaction so that its easier for an author to reach his/her readers and vice-versa. 

This is want Xplore is here to solve, with Xplore the aim is to bridge the gap between authors/writers and readers so that they can easily interact with them and tell them what they love about there books. 

It is also a community where writers can reach out to their fellow writers in time of need and get access to a variety of information and writers can continously find out what book to read and join book clubs of their liking to keep thing ineresting and fun always.
